# SoCW2Hackathon-DictionaryWebApp

(06/05/2022)  <br />
This little web app is the result of a day's work (roughly ~4/5 hours) for a Friday Hackathon in week 2 of the 16 week School of Code bootcamp.

The task was to select an API and make anything we wanted with it!
I decided to choose the dictionary app as I'm a big bookworm 🤓 and had wanted to do a project that incorporated dictionary data for a while.  <br />


## ---------- Funcionality ---------  <br />
The funcionality in this first version is essentially an MVP dictionary. You type a word in that you want a definition for and the defition appears below your search.  <br />


## ---------- Design ---------  <br />
The title of the dictionary and the design is loosely based on the Merriam Webster online dictionary.  <br />


## ---------- Future Intentions ---------  <br />
The functionality of the web app is the bare bones of a useful dictionary at the moment and I would like to add more functionality to the page.
Here is a list of features I would like to incorporate soon: 

• suggestions from the API that dropdown from the input field as the user types in a word <br />
• extract more data about the words from the dictionary API to give more results with each search <br />
• have the dictionary search when the user clicks enter (at present the user must press the search button) <br />
• have a prompt returned to the user if they misspell a word <br />
• expand the design to incorporate more design features frm the Merriam Webster site <br />
